IsOccluded: Indicates that the object is occluded by another object in the image.

IsTruncated: Indicates that the object extends beyond the boundary of the image.

IsGroupOf: Indicates that the box spans a group of objects (e.g., a bed of flowers or a crowd of people). We asked annotators to use this tag for cases with more than 5 instances which are heavily occluding each other and are physically touching.

IsDepiction: Indicates that the object is a depiction (e.g., a cartoon or drawing of the object, not a real physical instance).

IsInside: Indicates a picture taken from the inside of the object (e.g., a car interior or inside of a building).
